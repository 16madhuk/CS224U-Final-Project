Predicting the gender of a character based on words spoken to them in a movie \n
Madhu Karra and Gita Krishna 

Analysis of movie dialogue spoken to a character reveals important elements of gender biases in society. Elements of social norms are revealed through analysis of words spoken to a character. In movies, a large part of how characters are perceived is how other characters interact with them on screen.For this project, we will be focusing on the way that other characters implicitly gender a character through linguistic biases. In other words, we hope to find certain elements of language that are directed towards females only or males only, giving us some insight into gender roles and norms. We used Cornell movie dialogue data that we parsed appropriately to feed into our model. This data set has been used widely by various other scholars, and provides an abundance of information about each movie and its dialogues.
